# E-commerce Microservices

This project demonstrates a simple e-commerce system built using a microservices architecture. It consists of three main services:

1. **User Authentication Service**: Handles user registration and login, providing JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
2. **Product Management Service**: Manages product information, including creation, updates, and retrieval of product details.
3. **Order Processing Service**: Manages orders, including placing new orders and retrieving user order history.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Database: SQLite for simplicity and demonstration purposes (can be replaced with any SQL database)
- Authentication: JWT

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NarendraRavuri/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices
```

2. **Set up virtual environment (optional)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install dependencies**

Navigate to each service directory and install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Services

#### Without Docker

Navigate to each service directory and run the application.

```bash
flask run --port=5000  # For user_auth service
flask run --port=5001  # For product_management service
flask run --port=5002  # For order_processing service
```

#### With Docker Compose

To run all services together using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

The services can be accessed at the following URLs when running locally:

- User Authentication Service: `http://localhost:5001`
- Product Management Service: `http://localhost:5002`
- Order Processing Service: `http://localhost:5003`

```

3. **Create a Product** (as an authenticated user)

POST `http://localhost:5002/products`

Headers:

```

```

Payload:

```json

    "name": "New Product",
    "description": "Product Description",
    "price": 99.99,
    "quantity": 100
}
```

4. **Place an Order** (as an authenticated user)

POST `http://localhost:5003/orders`
